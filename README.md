**R.U.D.I.** is an AI-powered archivist bot designed to summarize, reformat, and preserve knowledge shared in Discord servers. It dives into old chats, pulls out links, code, images, and conversations, and gives them a clean, markdown-powered glow-up.

This repository documents the policy, permissions, and branding rules that support R.U.D.I. and all other Dead Coders Society tools.
